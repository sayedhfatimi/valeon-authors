    "bio": "I’m Sayed Hamid Fatimi, a software developer by craft, a philosopher by calling, and a lifelong student of truth. With roots in physics and a love for clean, expressive code, I build in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js—tools that let ideas take shape in the digital world.\n\nBeyond the syntax and structure lies a deeper pursuit. I write to explore the foundations of thought, reason, and reality. My books, The Philosophy of Reason and The Philosophy of Truth, are part of an ongoing journey—an attempt to weave clarity from complexity, and meaning from mystery.\n\nThis space is where code meets contemplation. You’re welcome to walk the path with me at valeon.blog.",
